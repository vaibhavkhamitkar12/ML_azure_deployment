### Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both businesses and individuals. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to develop a fraud detection system that can identify suspicious transactions with high accuracy.

##### - Features
##### - Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for training the machine learning model.
##### - Model Training: Different machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated to find the best-performing model.
##### - Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.
##### - Web Application: API has been generated through Azure Machine Learning which can be further used to give response for real-time fraud detection and analysis.



###### Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. Follow the instructions on the webpage to perform fraud detection on credit card transactions.

###### Data
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It can be found at ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

###### Model
The machine learning model is trained using the dataset mentioned above. Multiple algorithms are experimented with, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to identify the most effective model for fraud detection.

###### Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are presented and compared to assess the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.
